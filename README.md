#### [Habit Tracker - In progress](https://github.com/sarahc-dev/habit-tracker)
I am currently working on building a habit tracker using Next.js, TypeScript and Neon database. You can track your daily habits and see your progress. The project is deployed on Vercel [here](https://habit-tracker-sarahc.vercel.app/).

#### [Todolist project - Java](https://github.com/sarahc-dev/todolist-java-spring-boot)
After completing the 'Learn Java' introductory course, I rebuilt the backend of my Todolist app using Java Spring Boot. This works with my [Todolist frontend](https://github.com/sarahc-dev/todolist-frontend-nextjs).

#### CashMoney Uk
I worked with a small company on a redesign of their existing website using Next.js, TypeScript and TailwindCSS. It was a great learning experience, however due to some unforeseen issues deploying a Next.js project on Netlify, it did not going into production. But the design we worked on was used and the website [preview](https://chipper-faloodeh-f128c4.netlify.app/) I created showcases my frontend capabilities.

#### Codewars
I also completed my first 3kyu kata in [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/sarahc-dev/completed_solutions)! It took some thinking and I was so happy to see those green checks at the end!
